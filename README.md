### Hi there, I'm Emanuela 👋

## 🩺 From Nursing to 💻 Web Development

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm a former nurse passionately transitioning into the field of web development.

### 📚 Current Learning

I'm currently enrolled in a foundation course with [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) Cohort 30. This program is helping me build a strong foundation in web technologies and best practices.

### 🌐 Technical Skills

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a bit of React
- **Languages**: Python, Java, PHP
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git, GitHub

I've also completed several courses on Codecademy, where I've developed a practical understanding of web development and programming.

### 🎵 Interests

When I'm not coding, I immerse myself in music and literature. I play the flute and aspire to learn playing the piano.
