### 🩺 From Nursing to 💻 Web Development

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile!👋  
From nursing to coding, I'm on a quest to conquer web development.  


### 📚 Current Learning

I'm currently enrolled in a foundation course with [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) Cohort 30.  
This program is helping me build a strong foundation in web technologies and best practices.

### 🌐 Technical Skills

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Languages**: Python, Java, PHP
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git, GitHub

I've also completed several courses on Codecademy, where I've developed a practical understanding of web development and programming.

###  🌄 Other Interests

When I'm not coding, I love keeping active, being around people, and seeking out unique projects 🔍 🛠️.  
The great outdoors is where I find my reset button 🏞️.
